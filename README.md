## Getting Started

First of all, let me admit [this article](https://mannhowie.com/clean-architecture-node) is inspired to develop this project. Uncle Bob's famous [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) is a way to write resilient software.

I am introduced a simple API template for backend developers using clean architecture based on express application. This template is meant to help you with improved code.

**Main features**

| Title                                   | Description                 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| [**Bootstrap**](https://bit.ly/3VQCqXA) | Responsive frontend toolkit |
| [**Express**](https://bit.ly/3FeNkRi)   | Web application framework   |
| [**Mongoose**](https://bit.ly/3TA0ZGT)  | Object-document mapping     |
| [**Passport**](https://bit.ly/3W24cAr)  | Make authenticated requests |
| [**Multer**](https://bit.ly/3NhgEZr)    | Multipart/form-data upload  |
| [**JWT**](https://bit.ly/3W2dNrg)       | Secure between two parties  |
| [**Mocha**](https://bit.ly/3f95w3Q)     | JavaScript test framework   |

**The followings must be pre-installed on your machine:**

- Node.js,
- MongoDB,
- Redis

**Clone itemplate repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waiphyo285/itemplate-node-js.git
```

**Visit Public Postman Collection**

```
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10018411/2s83mbr5iK
```

**Navigate root directory and install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**Run app and then go to browser**

```bash
npm run dev
localhost:6060
```

**TDD `./../.spec.js` in controllers**

```
npm run test
```

**CLI commands in src/cli**

```bash
node index
node index --index
node index --show=623210497fc2cb28840d1448
```

\_Note: this application is different to the Clean Architecture diagram above but attempts to achieve the same outcome.
